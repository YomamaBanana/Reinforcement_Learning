# A Simple Example on Reinforcement Learning (RL)

This example demonstrates the effectiveness, though on as scale, of reinforcement learning in a control system proces. This example is heavily inspired by the rocket example provided by [Daniel Brummerloh (2020)](https://towardsdatascience.com/ultimate-guide-for-reinforced-learning-part-1-creating-a-game-956f1f2b0a91). This example is divided based the objective of the algorithms such as obstacles avoidance, path tracking etc.


## Objective

This example focuses on thhe following objectives:

1. obstacles avoidance
2. object tracking
